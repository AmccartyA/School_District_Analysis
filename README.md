# School_District_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to find the passing percentages of the current High school students while seeing if there is any correlation with the budget per student spent. To test how data is affected, we are removing the Thomas High School Ninth graders from our data and re-evaluating the information.
 
## How is the district summary affected?
 
After comparing both district summaries, the overall data was not affected significantly.
 
## How was the school summary affected?
 
The overall passing for Thomas High School was 90.9% in the original file, with the change by taking the 9th graders of Thomas High out, the school summary of overall passing only shrinks to 90.6%, showing a very small change out our data.
 
## How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
